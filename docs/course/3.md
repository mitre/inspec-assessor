## 3. Command line overview

### 3.1. What it is
Command line is the text input and output environment that allows us to process commands on the computer. We refer to these terminal instances as "windows"

### 3.2. Common commands

This will output your current working directory:
```bash
pwd
```

This will output whatever is passed into the terminal:
```bash
echo Hello World
```

This will output the contents of the directory you are in:
```bash
ls
```

We can also pass in the `-a` flag to show hidden files in the directory
```bash
ls -a
```

The `cd` command stands for change directory. This allows us to traverse the filesystem via the terminal.
To go up a directory:
```bash
cd ..
```
To go into a directory replace `<DirectoryName>` with the actual directory name:
```bash
cd <DirectoryName>
```

The `mkdir` command stands for make directory. We can use this to create new folders:
```bash
mkdir testFolder
```

The `touch` command is used to create a new file. You can add any extension you want but for this example we are creating a txt file.
```bash
touch testfile.txt
```

The `cat` command is used to display the contents of a file.
```bash
cat testfile.txt
```

### Exercise

1) Let's create a directory called `Assessor`
2) Change directory to get into the `Assessor` directory
3) Output your current working directory
4) Create a file called `example.txt`
5) Open the file `example.txt` and type something in there
6) Back in the terminal display the contents of the `example.txt` file
