## 8. Using an --input-file to tailor specifics

The following inputs may be configured in an inputs ".yml" file for the profile to run correctly for your specific environment. More information about InSpec inputs can be found in the [InSpec Profile Documentation](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/profiles/).

In the below example we are using the inputs for the [Redhat 7 Github profile](https://github.com/mitre/redhat-enterprise-linux-7-stig-baseline#tailoring-to-your-environment).  We can tailor the following inputs in a new file called `inputs.yml` and pass that into our execution script.

```yaml

For this example we have 3 controls that run very long depending on the file system that is being queried. Our `inputs.yml` file could look like this:

```yaml
# Used by InSpec checks V-71849, V-71855, V-72037
# InSpec Tests that are known to consistently have long run times (V-71849, V-71855, V-72037) can be disabled with this attribute
# Acceptable values: false, true
# (default: false)
disable_slow_controls: true
```
